> Make your website accessible to everyone over the internet.

The core elements that make up a website: web files, servers, domain names.

First, we already have a web file.  

So, what we need is a server and a domain name.  

Usually, both the server and the domain name come with a high fee. However, some providers offer us free servers or domain names.  

For example, Github Pages. However, this usually has some limitations, you can only have 1 server for free per Github account, and you have to open source the code.  

Finally, here are some common free servers or domain names. Find what you think is the best to use it!  

[Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/):  

- GitHub Pages offers free static website hosting, making it easy for users to deploy their projects to the internet.
- You can host your website directly from your GitHub repository and manage version control through Git.
- Free domain name and HTTPS support for websites.
- GitHub Pages only supports static websites and does not support back-end languages or databases, limiting the development of some dynamic websites.
- The website must be completely open-source.
- Each Github user can only host 1 website for free, with certain resource limits.

[GitLab Pages](https://pages.gitlab.io/):  

- Similar to a Github Pages.
- Support for more frameworks.
- It is more difficult to use.

[Gitee Pages](https://gitee.com/pages/):  

- Similar to a Github Pages.
- Mandatory real-name realization.
- In China, access is fast.

[Vercel](https://vercel.com/):  

- It's fast to build.
- It's very simple to use.
- Supports importing projects on Github and GitLab.
- Access is unstable.

If it's paid, it's relatively complicated to use and requires the purchase of a domain name (otherwise it can only be accessed via IP).  

In general, free servers are enough for us, unless you have a lot of websites. And, hosting on the platform provides free defense against DDOS attacks.  

I won't go into detail about how to use it here.  

If you succeed, congratulations! This is your first website! Uh, probably not the first......
