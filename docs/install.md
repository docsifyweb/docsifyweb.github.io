> Install docsify.

Docsify doesn't work out of the box, but it's easy to install.  

Docsify relies on Node.js and npm, so ensure they're installed on your system.  

Install Node.js: https://nodejs.org/en  

> [!Tip]
> npm comes bundled with Node.js, so there's no separate installation required.

But, Node.js does not come with docsify built-in, we can use the following command to install it globally.  

```bash
npm i docsify-cli -g
```

If no error is generated, the installation is successful.  

If `-g` is not added, it is considered a partial installation. It's not convenient.  

Now, you're ready to start building a documentation website with Docsify!  

> [!Attention]
> If your Node.js version is too old, you may not be able to use docsify properly.
