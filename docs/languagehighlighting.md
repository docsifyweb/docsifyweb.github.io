# Language highlighting

> Use Prism to highlight blocks of code in a page.

Docsify uses [Prism](https://prismjs.com/) to highlight code blocks in your pages. Prism supports the following languages by default: Markup, CSS, C-like, JavaScript.  

To highlight the code for these languages, simply specify the programming language correctly.  

If you are speaking another language, support for [additional languages](https://prismjs.com/#supported-languages/) is available by loading the language-specific [grammar files](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/prismjs@1/components/) via CDN.  

```html
<script src="//cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/prismjs@1/components/prism-bash.min.js"></script>
<script src="//cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/prismjs@1/components/prism-php.min.js"></script>
```
